# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Levi Miller

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on the 28th of November, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 :: Wednesday, the 28th of November (1/1)
Today's Progress: Started Problem Set 3 in Harvard's CS50 course through edx (CS50x). 
                  Explored freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

Thoughts: I am a motivated machine! I woke up early so I could get in an hour coding in anticipation of working until late tonight.

### R1D2 :: Thursday, the 29th of November (2/2)
Today's Progress: Finished Problem Set 3 of CS50x.

Thoughts: I took almost three hours to finish this assignment. I went down a whole of trying to figure out an algorithm for adjusting a frequency based on a difference in octave, note, and accidental. The solution was much simpler than I anticipated: a series of if/else if/else statement. I wondered about the value of learning the C syntax and wrestling with these problems. Regardless, I feel super accomplished at having made it through another problem set!

### R1D3-R1D5 :: Friday, the 30th of November to Sunday, the 2nd of December (2/5)
The days' progress: None.

Thoughts: I visited the Bay with my wife; her family lives there. As it so happens, a brother from another mother lives there as well. I was itching to keep coding and progressing. I want to move past CS50x so I can focus on a language and start building a portfolio. However, I can't neglect the fundamentals! Saturday was the closest day to a day off as I can remember; I really did almost nothing: nothing productive, hardly anything explicitly entertaining. There was a sense of peace and ease that I found in a few moments that was at first alien and then regenerative. That said, I feel my weekend days are the most valuable for advancing my skills as a computer scientist, software engineer, developer.

Link to work: NA

### R1D6 :: Monday, the 3rd of December (3/6)
Today's Progress: Watched Week 4's lecture in CS50x.

Thoughts: David Mahan's lectures stretch on for over an hour and a half. Lectures have not been the best means of teaching me something, yet his lectures are so finely tuned that I feel compelled to watch them. He spoke of what goes on under the hood of C; the callouts to addresses in physical memory that can stump one when a function or variable does not behave as expect. I am hungry to keep writing!

### R1D7 :: Tuesday, the 4th of December (4/7)
Today's Progress: Completed Whodunit from PSET4 of CS50x.

Thoughts: This part of the problem set was a deep dive in the structure of a file, taking me to the granularity of individual bytes. The task seemed overwhelming, until I realized that the powers that be had all but given the answer away. All I wrote was a simple if statement to change the byte values of a pixel (or RGB TRIPLE) to different values! Nonetheless, the assignment was a valuable exploration of file formats. I'm excited to cut my teeth on the next part of the problem set tomorrow.

Link to work: It was Professor Plum with the candlestick in the library.

### R1D8 :: Wednesday , the 5th of December (5/8)
Today's Progress: Started Resize from PSET4 of CS50x.

Thoughts: The problems seem to get bigger, but really they're just deeper. I had to squeeze in my hour of code in between commitments at work and with my wife, and I got a lay of the land. I studied the header structure of the BITMAP only to feel totally lost as to how to reassign values to its different elements.

Link to work: None.

### R1D9 :: Thursday, the 6th of December (6/9)
Today's Progress: Continued Resize from PSET4 of CS50x.

Thoughts: Today was a hard day. I felt tired. Maybe I was a little size or rundown. I've been really hard on myself. I came home and slept for an hour. Then I ate and played video games and chatted with my wife. Not until around 8:30 did I muster up the gumption to peer at code again. Feeling totally lost on an assignment takes the wind out of your sails. Nagging doubts about the economy, state of the world, future employability... well, those don't do you any favors either. I tried to go easy on myself and spied a solution to the Resize problem, using it to understand what was possible and how to assign new values to the header. I still don't totally understand it, so I'm going to peer into the supplemental videos and the previous assignment tomorrow.

Link to work: None.

### R1D10 :: Friday, the 7th of December (6/10)
Today's Progress: None.

Thoughts: Like yesterday, I felt down and out. I let the feelings take me, and I didn't code.

Link to work: None.

### R1D11 :: Saturday, the 8th of December (7/11)
Today's Progress: Completed PSET4.

Thoughts: After some grappling with the problem set and poring over Stack Overflow and other programming blogs, I figured out how to implement Resize and Recover in CS50x'a PSET4. I didn't feel quite as accomplished, as I had to pretty well read everyone else's struggles and tips to figure my situation out, but the results of my work were cool! And I understood its function./

### R1D12 :: Sunday, the 9th of December (8/12)
Today's Progress:  Watch an hour of CS50x's Week 4 lecture.

Thoughts: I was too tired after a couple of holiday parties the night before to make much progress. I did find the courage to dip into the next of David J. Malan's lectures. Does this study count as code?

Link to work: None.

### R1D13 :: Monday, the 10th of December (9/13)
Today's Progress: Finish watching the Week 4 lecture, begin PSET5.

Thoughts: This next problem looks like a real whammy. I am wondering what I am learning by jumping into such a deep pool of concepts such as linked lists, hash tables, and tries. I trust I'll come out the other side with a firmer handle on what exactly we are doing as computer scientists, software developers, programmers, whathaveyou. The scope of the lone problem in the PSET alone is a challenge!

Link to work: None.

### R1D14 :: Tuesday, the 11th of December (10/14)
Today's Progress: Continued wrestling with PSET5: coding the backend of a spellchecker.

Thoughts: Speller is a tremendous problem. I am proud to say morale is high; I would be happy to spend all day tomorrow working on it if I didn't have to go to work. I am trying to learn the fundamentals: what is a linked list vs a hash table vs a trie, how do nodes and pointers work, in what manner and fashion to we allocate and reallocate memory. What does C mean?! I have four functions to complete, and I am chipping away at the first. I learned to part structures and custom types and have decided on using a hash table for beginner's sake. I still haven't really written lines of code perse, but I am certainly learning to read them, and that is the first step!

Link to work: None.

### R1D15 :: Wednesday, the 12th of December (11/15)
Today's Progress: Hashed out hash tables. Started wrapping my mind around linked lists.

Thoughts: So Speller is a really huge problem for a beginner like myself. I've stated this fact the previous two days, and now I realize how unsystematic I've been in tackling it. That just won't do! What are takeaways? Make sure you (I) can implement the basics, basic functions, loops, structures, etc that will eventually comprise the final program. I've assumed I can watch videos, write a few notes, and shoot from the hip. It's clear I don't truly understand what's going on. I'm excited to go over everything with a finer toothed comb tomorrow. And let's keep in mind: What is the goal? What do I want?

Link to work: None.

### R1D16 :: Thursday, the 13th of December (12/16)
Today's Progress: Practiced Dynamic Memory Allocation and Pointers.

Thoughts: I need practice. Fortunately, I found https://study.cs50.net/ which features crisply distilled notes from CS50 and plenty of little exercises to practice core concepts. I believe I understand pointers (better). "A pointer is a variable that stores memory addresses." The value of the pointer is the memory address, which the type of pointer describes the type of data at that address. For example, "char* str = "what";" gives the address of the series of characters of what. "int* a = 7;" gives the address in memory of an integer 7. Calling * a gives the value while & a gives the address. I belive we are making baby steps. I'm eager to move on to other things, but I (believe I) need to understand these basics. I have to hunker down and focus and believe I can do this!!!

Link to work: None.

### R1D17-R1D18 :: Friday, the 14th of December to Saturday, the 15th of December (12/18)
Today's Progress: None.

Thoughts: Holiday parties, chores, and the siren song of the weekend lured me away from my programming practice.

Link to work: None.

### R1D19 :: Sunday, the 16th of December (13/19)
Today's Progress: Wrestling with Linked Lists.

Thoughts: I am struggling to understand linked lists and the nodes and pointers they require! I trust that by practicing problems, things will sync in. I did learn how to commit work to GitHub from Cloud9, so I can now have a record of activity on GitHub! Woo! 

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/c9test

### R1D20 :: Monday, the 17th of December (14/20)
Today's Progress: Continued struggling with Linked Lists.

Thoughts: Every bit of time that passes with these things, I can feel that I can come closer to that mystical "Aha!" moment. I have been commenting code extensively and trying to backwards map solutions to other problems to speed my own process up. It's hard to put a timeline on learning, but I feel the pressure to move on to other things. I have started practicing at HackerRank to keep my Python fresh and to put my finger on the pulse of regular coding exercises. In all of the studying that I've been doing (videos watched, forums scanned, notes read), I cannot forget to just write lines of code. At this stage in the game, it's critical for me to keep that balance.

### R1D21 :: Tuesday, the 18th of December (15/21)
Today's Progress: Continued struggling with Linked Lists.

### R1D22 :: Wednesday, the 19th of December (16/22)
Today's Progress: HackerRank Day 8 of 30 Days of Code, Cash and Fahrenheit problems of CS50x/AP

Thoughts: Today was another hard day, ala Day 9. I'm really proud that I was disciplined enough to put in the time that I did, but I definitely felt in an mental-emotional slump that began with the beginning of the day and spiralled down, down, down until about 4:00 PM, when my wife told me it was okay to just chill out. I don't feel like I can afford to chill out, not when I'm trying to change careers in 8 months. I've been plugging through problems on HackerRank, which has been good Python review for me and may help me prepare for job interviews. According to reports I've read, the most in demand languages will be JavaScript, Python, and C++. I'm excited to jump on JavaScript, but I have to take care that I don't jump ship for its newness. CS50x PSET5 calls. I trust that with great blocks of time this break, I can crack the nut. I'm planning on at least 10 solid days of bootcamp, days of finishing CS50x, mapping the next few months of learning to job opportunities, and conceptualizing projects which I and potential employers will be struck by and interested in.

### R1D23 :: Thursday, the 20th of December (17/23)
Today's Progress: HackerRank Day 9 of 30 Days of Code. Finally got PSET5 to compile!

Thoughts: Aaaaand we're back! I tore back into PSET5, rewatching the impeccable yet elusive walkthroughs provided by CS50 and piecing together the needed materials from my own grown knowledge and bits and pieces from Reddit and Stack Overflow. I got the darn thing to compile! The load() function, responsible for loading a dictionary file into the program, is not totally working correctly. These problems are due to my own elusive grasp of pointers. I know what they are, but clearly I do not yet understand them. Regardless, today marked a day where I felt much more capable and literate than I have previously. We're going to make it! One step at a time...

### R1D24 :: Friday, the 21st of December (18/24)
Today's Progress: Pushed updates to PSET5 practice. 

Thoughts: Today marked the Winter Solstice, and the last day of school for 16-and-a-half days. To celebrate, I didn't do too much. I kept some streaks going, though, to be sure. I pushed some code in the CS50 IDE that I had added yesterday or the day before and neglected to update to Git. For that, I'll give myself a day. Play smarter, not harder! Keep those cards close to your chest! And get ready to kick some ass this break, because, going forward, Friday evening is the only break your going to get. Let's relive junior year of Mines all over again.

### R1D25 :: Saturday, the 22nd of December (18/25)
Today's Progress: None.

Thoughts: I went up to Bay with my bae and was pretty fatigued today. Not knowing exactly what to spend time on, I just let go of committing to an hour of code.

Link to work: None.

### R1D26 :: Sunday, the 23rd of December (19/26)
Today's Progress: Lecture 7 of Week 6 of CS50x and 1 HackerRank challenge.

Thoughts: Every little bit counts! I was inspired by the lecture on dynamic programming to come up with algorithms for my Seating Smart seating chart app. Can't wait to get to work on it! Busy with family and friend stuff. Of course, it is the holidays!

Link to work: None.

### R1D27-R1D29 :: Monday, the 24th of December to Wednesday, the 26th of December (19/29)
Today's Progress: The Holidays.

Thoughts: The Holidays.

Link to work: The Holidays.

### R1D30 :: Thursday, the 27th of December (20/30)
Today's Progress: FINALLY FINISHED PSET5! Lectures 8 and 9 of Weeks 7 and 8 of CS50x. Part of PSET6.

Thoughts: Today was Day 1 of my homebrewed coding boot camp. My goals: finish CS50x by the end of year and launch into the next chapter of self-development of becoming a developer. It's so nice having full days to work!

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/cs50x_speller, https://github.com/levimllr/cs50x-pset6

### R1D31 :: Friday, the 28th of December (21/31)
Today's Progress: Completed PSET6, porting several previous programs to Python and implementing a website which compares strings.

Thoughts: Day 2 of Slipper Camp. I am getting more and more excited now! Dynamic websites are so cool and useful and CS50 is breaking out all kinds of cool tools to build them: Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, Flask, Jinja, and so on...

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/cs50x-pset6

### R1D32 :: Saturday, the 29th of December (22/32)
Today's Progress: Completed PSET7, creating a website that facilitates virtual stock trading.

Thoughts: Day 3 of Loafer Camp. The rubber is truly meeting the road in the sense that I am in the zone and loving building things. I worked from 7:30 AM to 9:30 PM with a few breaks in between. I feel like I can make anything, and understand the basic underpinnings of how web apps work. I just want to keep building things! Until tomorrow...

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/cs50x_finance

### R1D33 :: Sunday, the 30th of December (23/33)
Today's Progress: Completed PSET8, creating a website that displays local news using the Google News and Google Maps APIs.

Thoughts: Day 4 of Pajama Camp. This assignment was really tough. It was tough because it involved so many languages, libraries, APIs, and a slew of trappings I might have overlooked. I got emotionally frustrated at one point today, partially because of the pressure I'm feeling to "progress" in my abilities at an appropriate pace and close out this class. I'm excited to take on the final project and work on something of my own design!

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/cd50x-mashup

### R1D34 :: Monday, the 31st of December (24/34)
Today's Progress: Decided on my final project for CS50x.

Thoughts: Day 5 of Leasure Camp. In all seriousness, today was an easier day, in part because of the spirit of New Year's Eve, but also because I had no formal problem set to solve! Instead, I watched the final lecture of CS50x, and then putzed around for a few around before settling on an idea for my final project. While I was pretty attached to the idea of making a seating chart webapp, a pretty robust (albeit a bit awkard) one already exists! It occurred to me, we the zeitgeist of resolutions in the air, that a web-controlled habit tracker light would be a cool and useful tool. Introducing Unicorn Pi Habits, or Raspberry Hat Habits, or Unicorn Raspberry Tracker. My goal is to make a streamlined web app that allows users to track their habits on a website, and have a heatmap of their habits displayed on a Unicorn HAT RGB LED grid interfaced with a Raspberry Pi that also works as a server. I am so excited! 

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D35 :: Tuesday, the 1st of January (25/35)
Today's Progress: Set up Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, toyed with Unicorn HAT. Brainstormed Pi Habits user interface.

Thoughts: Day 6 of Track Pants Camp. Most of the day ran away from me before I began coding (it was after 7 when I typed my first for loop). Time was spent cleaning, catching up with old friend, doing good, productive things. But we need to code! The Raspberry Pi platform and Unicorn HAT hardware are essential to this project, and spend some time setting them up. The makers of Unicorn HAT developed a web app called Unicorn Paint which is like MSPaint but with a hardware flash-biz-bang from the 8x8 LED grid. Unicorn Paint runs with Flask, too! It seems the essential pieces already exist and merely need be stitched together. I wonder how many software projects are like this. Is an hour of code really an hour of coding? I think it should be in my case, as I hardly qualify as literate. But I will say it is super motivating having a project and idea of my own and birthing it into the world with such (relative) each. What other craft is like this?!

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D36 :: Wednesday, the 2nd of January (26/36)
Today's Progress: Set up Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+'s (RPi's) server and remote desktop capabilities. Thought about Pi Habits website.

Thoughts: Day 7 of Sneaker Camp. Not much work done today as most of the time was past sharing conversation with my wife's brother, a fellowship long overdue! I am realizing how crucial every moment, every precious minute, is to setting myself up for more, better job opportunities in six months, and so finally at 8 PM I began tearing into things, starting with setting up the RPi as a remote desktop and web server. The basic installations are done. A lot of this work lies in getting comfortable with tools and language. Thank God for Google! I need to make sure I get in at least an hour of hard coding every day, though, even if it doesn't deal with some project.

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D37 :: Thursday, the 3rd of January (27/37)
Today's Progress: Integrated cal-heatmap with PiHabits and developed basic register/add/remove pages.

Thoughts: Day 8 of Undershirt Camp. I cranked away today, almost all day, but not at the level of efficiency I had hoped. I wrangled and was nearly emotionally bested by a problem integrating a JavaScript module with my site package in the CS50 Cloud9 IDE. The afternoon proved to hold the solution when I took a gander at Chrome's console readout for the page. I spent the rest of my time coding CSS and getting parts to play between HTML, Python, and SQL. Next stop: export data to JavaScript and the Unicorn HAT on Raspberry Pi! I wish I had another week.

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D38 :: Friday, the 4th of January (28/38)
Today's Progress: Figured out some PHP and SQL stuff. Decided on Cal-Heatmap presentation. Worked on porting data.

Thoughts: Day 9 of Athletic Short Camp. Miscommunications betwen HTML, CSS, SQL, PHP, JS, and Python plagued me today, and I crawled. I solve one problem only to find it's not quite the right solution, or to find another issue staring me in the face. Am I learning?

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D39 :: Saturday, the 5th of January (29/39)
Today's Progress: Solved the miscommunication between PHP and SQL by sidestepping around it.

Thoughts: Day 10(ish) of Huarache Camp. I am learning! I solved two challenges on Hacker Array, stressed over which domain name to purchase for my portfolio site, and found it in my to face PiHabits in the late of evening. Within 5 minutes of revisiting my code, it occurred to me to simply call the Unix timestamp (a curious timestamp measuring the number of seconds passed since some date in the 70s) with Python and stick it in my SQL database instead of dealing with another mystery error in my PHP. I do need to tease apart the difference between PHP and SQL, because at my current distance they look the same: like a problem. One more major hurdle before a deserved refinement: exporting activity data from database to another program on the RPi so as to update the lighting on the Unicorn HAT. Never done anything like it, nor do I have explicit training doing so. Here's where the going gets fun!

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D40 :: Sunday, the 6th of January (30/40)
Today's Progress: Worked through 2 HackerRank coding challenges, rolled the RPi website-hardware communication around.

Thoughts: Day 10 (really) of Break Camp. Didn't make much progress today. I made sure to keep up with HackerRank, which is teaching me that I don't quite have my programming fundamentals down (which means I am likely to get lost in the woods with this project). My real job starts back up tomorrow, and I am bracing for it. I fantasize about squeezing in an hour of code before work and spending all of my freedom afterwards on it. Let's crunch the numbers. Say I work from 7:15 AM to 4:15 PM, a respectable 9-hour day. I could wake up at 5 AM, workout and eat until 6, and code from 6 to 7 AM. Coming home at 4:30 PM, I could take an hour-long break and crack back into things between 5:30 and 8:30 PM, finally going to bed at 9. So the goal: 4 hours of action per weekday, barring any events. If consistent Monday through Thursday, take Friday evening off. How about the weekend? Keep (almost) the same schedule. Sleep by 9. Wake up by 6 AM. Get to coding by 8 AM. Stop for a break at noon. Pick back up at 1 PM and stop at 5. Pick back up at 6 and stop at 8. There's 10 hours. Could you do it again Sunday? There's another 10. You could possibly learn and code for 40 hours per week! Why am I writing about this? I need a set schedule. It's January 6th. School will be out in five months on June 6th. I should be confidently applying for jobs after three-four more months. I should be able to excel at my job at school with 45-hour workweeks. Break was fun and productive, but now it's time to tighten the screws even more. My goal by this coming Sunday the 13th is to be done with a minimum viable product for my CS50 final and apply for my certification.

### R1D41 :: Monday, the 7th of January (31/41)
Today's Progress: PiHabits site running on RPi. Attempts to communicate with hardware from server.

Thoughts: A lofty goal of coding by 5:30 PM rolled into coding by 6:30, but we charged through to 8:30. I'm sorry to say I feel I could die by a thousand cuts. If it's not directory mistakes or user permissions it's missing libraries and plain bad beginner's code on my part. But we've got to keep up the discipline! My goal tomorrow: Have the server talking to the Pi Hardware, and have the hardware update with changes in the database. We can do it!

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D42 :: Tuesday, the 8th of January (32/42)
Today's Progress: Server communicates with hardware with admin permissions. Began building list/array for mapping time+activity data to LED+intensity.

Thoughts: Not as much progress again as hoped. Didn't dive in until 7, but then cruised through 'til 10:30 with but a break to talk to my love who was driving home from the Bay. I fear I'm languishing in this project. I spent a while just figuring out how to get the Raspberry Pi to commit to Github. I feel like such a fool! And I feel like I'm running out of time. I have to, have to, have to make sure I'm workly intelligently and efficiently. That's the only way this homebrewed developer game can work.

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D43 :: Wednesday, the 9th of January (32/43)
Today's Goal: Code in the morning! 6:00-7:00 AM.

Today's Progress: None.

Thoughts: It was good to go out and volunteer to serve soup at the vigil. Talking with and meeting new people of different backgrounds is invigorating, nutrifying, edificating.

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D44 :: Thursday, the 10th of January (33/44)
Today's Goal: Turn on the lights with the web app!

Today's Progress: I did just that.

Thoughts: Running the server as sudo, and getting my array ducks in a row, I managed to swiftly and simply get data from the SQL database to the pixel array. It struck me as effortless, after days of wandering in the desert. C'est la vie!

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D45 :: Friday, the 11th of January (34/45)
Today's Goal: Make the web app visible from outside the Pi.

Today's Progress: I did just that.

Thoughts: A wandering through Google and StackFlow rendered a series of fixes for the RPi: adding lines to hosts and initalize files within the arcane /etc folder. Explicitly running the flask server at a certain IP address (flask run --host=0.0.0.0) was the critical move. Now I can access the site from any device in the network using the Pi's IP address and the appropriate port!

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D46 :: Saturday, the 12th of January (35/46)
Today's Goal: Submit PiHabits, my CS50x final project, chart the next steps in studying computer science/development/programming, execute a few of those steps. Put in at least 8 solid hours of learning and coding.

Today's Progress: I did it!

Thoughts: PiHabits reached MVP (Minimum Viable Product) status and I kicked that dude out the door. I submitted my things to CS50x; here's hoping I pass and get my certificate. Now I'm at a loss. Do I study Python or JavaScript? I have less than five months until I move and three months until I should start applying for jobs.

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/pi-habits

### R1D47 :: Sunday, the 13th of January (36/47)
Today's Goal: Chart the next steps in studying computer science/development/programming, execute a few of those steps. Put in at least 8 solid hours of learning and coding.

Today's Progress: Looked up jobs, decided on Python and JavaScript as a focus for the next month. Worked through hours of material in Udemy Python Bootcamp, or Python Udemy Bootcamp, or PUB.

Thoughts: I felt better after looking at a few job postings online. I have 2+ years of experience with software development! I have managed small teams of programmers. I am fluent in the IoT. Bring. It. On. So, goals for the next 1-2 weeks. We're going to finish the old Python bootcamp started in the summer. It felt good going back to it; I've learned a few things. However, I have a long way to go. 

Link to work: https://github.com/levimllr/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp

### R1D48 :: Monday, the 14th of January (37/48)
Today's Goal: Squeeze in at least an hour of work in the PUB. Review Milestone Project 1 and reach OOP HW. Check in on Digital Musicbox project and see about porting sculptures to Pi. Set up grading and management of freshmen.

Today's Progress: Came close to the Hour (closing AWatch Activity Rings took priority). Tic-Tac-Toe works (with bonus features!) and we got a taste of OOP. Digital Musicbox is on pause (need to investigate Kivy!). Grading was a dumpster fire.

Thoughts: I'm hungry to learn. Thinking about researching coding bootcamps. Web development seems the way into the software engineering industry. The To-Do list extends: setting up blog with WordPress and domain, finding a way to keep GitHub contributions up, keeping up with DPEA programmers, staying on top of it all.... It's days like today that will prove me out, though. Squeeze in those hours! It helps to have (a) class.

### R1D49 :: Tuesday, the 15th of January (38/49)
Today's Goal: Finish OOP section of PUB, have activity on GitHub.

Today's Progress: Done and done!

Thoughts: Truthfully I only worked an hour today, even after being home by 4:15 PM. It's amazing how a workout, chat, dinner, round of XCOM, checking e-mails, and sex can lead one through three hours relatively quickly. Things feel "easy" now. Too easy. Not like CS50. The best thing I can do is crush this Udemy course and look for my next victim.

### R1D50 :: Wednesday, the 16th of January (39/50)
Today's Goal: Reach and begin Milestone Project 2 of PUB.

Today's Progress: 44% - 46% of PUB while completing section 9. Toyed with adding streak lights to PiHabits.

Thoughts: A surprise dinner guest asnd drive to close my rings pushed me to start at 7:30 PM, and an intention to go to bed by 9:30 PM has me winding down at 8:30. I cracked open PiHabits to puzzle over adding an 8th light at the bottom of a week's column to indicate of 7 days of activity had been met. I made some progress in writing a loop, but it wasn't perfect. I finished a short unit in the PUB on modules and packages, which was useful, but will need some application to really sink in. I am proud of the fact that I got some coding in before the dinner guest came at 5:30. I'm not proud of the fact that it feels like I'm crawling through this material. I have to remember that I have another full-time job (and it's finals week no less). I also have to remember I have at most three months before I must start applying for jobs.

### R1D51 :: Thursday, the 17th of January (40/51)
Today's Goal: Reach and begin Milestone Project 2 of PUB.

Today's Progress: 46 - 49% of PUB. Started Milestone Project 2 of PUB. Fixed "Sunday bug" of the PiHAbits

Thoughts: I don't feel like I'm really learning or internalizing much of this Complete Python Bootcamp. Rather, I feel like I'm being shown how things work. I did learn some useful information, though, about how spaces are preferable to tabs in coding, and about the general purpose and implementation of try-except statements in Python. And it's good practice to leave a bonus empty line at the end of your code! I felt into copy-pasta mode beginning work with the second Milestone Project and that experience was pretty empty. Object-Oriented Programming is definitely the next great frontier for me! Just gotta keep up the grind and crush this bootcamp so I can move on to another project.

### R1D53 :: Saturday, the 19th of January (41/53)
Today's Goal: Finish Milestone Project 2 of PUB. Git contribution =< 1.

Today's Progress: 49-49% of PUB. Contributed to Git! Added a streak light to PiHabits.

Thoughts: Even after driving to and from LA to see relatives, I found the gumption to code. I implemented a feature I've imaging from the beginning: a light in the bottom-most row of the UnicornHAT (an 8x8 LED grid) that turned on when a whole week contains activity.

### R1D54 :: Sunday, the 20th of January (42/54)
Today's Goal: Finish Milestone Project 2 of PUB. Git contribution =< 1.

Today's Progress: 49-49% of PUB. Contributed to Git! Added comments to PiHabits code.

Thoughts: I spent the better parts of the day hiking with my friend Tommy (so good to get out in Nature) and preparing to apply for a job at IXL Learning (an ed tech company in San Mateo). Over the course of the day, I've learned that I am a bit insecure about my new identity as an engineer/manager, rich in experience and skills, and full of potential to have a sharp resume in April if I keep the faith with regards to learning programming.

### R1D55 :: Monday, the 21st of January (43/55)
Today's Goal: Finish Milestone Project 2 of PUB. Git contribution =< 1.

Today's Progress: 49-50% of PUB. Contributed to Git! Finished Milestone Project 2.

Thoughts: Today I was... pragmatic? Lazy? My love and I put the finishing touches on my resume and cover letter for a job. After a couple-day hiatus, I dipped back into PUB and treated the middle project as a code-along project. I felt like I got it, but we'll see how the approach works. I want to get this course behind me and sink my teeth into some real problems! And explore JavaScript. The path is not so clear.
