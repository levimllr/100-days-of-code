# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Levi Miller

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on the 28th of November, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 :: Wednesday, the 28th of November (1/1)
Today's Progress: Started Problem Set 3 in Harvard's CS50 course through edx (CS50x). 
                  Explored freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

Thoughts: I am a motivated machine! I woke up early so I could get in an hour coding in anticipation of working until late tonight.

### R1D2 :: Thursday, the 29th of November (2/2)
Today's Progress: Finished Problem Set 3 of CS50x.

Thoughts: I took almost three hours to finish this assignment. I went down a whole of trying to figure out an algorithm for adjusting a frequency based on a difference in octave, note, and accidental. The solution was much simpler than I anticipated: a series of if/else if/else statement. I wondered about the value of learning the C syntax and wrestling with these problems. Regardless, I feel super accomplished at having made it through another problem set!

### R1D3-R1D5 :: Friday, the 30th of November to Sunday, the 2nd of December (2/5)
The days' progress: None.

Thoughts: I visited the Bay with my wife; her family lives there. As it so happens, a brother from another mother lives there as well. I was itching to keep coding and progressing. I want to move past CS50x so I can focus on a language and start building a portfolio. However, I can't neglect the fundamentals! Saturday was the closest day to a day off as I can remember; I really did almost nothing: nothing productive, hardly anything explicitly entertaining. There was a sense of peace and ease that I found in a few moments that was at first alien and then regenerative. That said, I feel my weekend days are the most valuable for advancing my skills as a computer scientist, software engineer, developer.

### R1D6 :: Monday, the 3rd of December (3/6)
Today's Progress: Watched Week 4's lecture in CS50x.

Thoughts: David Mahan's lectures stretch on for over an hour and a half. Lectures have not been the best means of teaching me something, yet his lectures are so finely tuned that I feel compelled to watch them. He spoke of what goes on under the hood of C; the callouts to addresses in physical memory that can stump one when a function or variable does not behave as expect. I am hungry to keep writing!

### R1D7 :: Tuesday, the 4th of December (4/7)
Today's Progress: Completed Whodunit from PSET4 of CS50x.

Thoughts: This part of the problem set was a deep dive in the structure of a file, taking me to the granularity of individual bytes. The task seemed overwhelming, until I realized that the powers that be had all but given the answer away. All I wrote was a simple if statement to change the byte values of a pixel (or RGB TRIPLE) to different values! Nonetheless, the assignment was a valuable exploration of file formats. I'm excited to cut my teeth on the next part of the problem set tomorrow.

Link to work: It was Professor Plum with the candlestick in the library.

### R1D8 :: Wednesday , the 5th of December (5/8)
Today's Progress: Started Resize from PSET4 of CS50x.

Thoughts: The problems seem to get bigger, but really they're just deeper. I had to squeeze in my hour of code in between commitments at work and with my wife, and I got a lay of the land. I studied the header structure of the BITMAP only to feel totally lost as to how to reassign values to its different elements.

Link to work: None.

### R1D9 :: Thursday, the 6th of December (6/9)
Today's Progress: Continued Resize from PSET4 of CS50x.

Thoughts: Today was a hard day. I felt tired. Maybe I was a little size or rundown. I've been really hard on myself. I came home and slept for an hour. Then I ate and played video games and chatted with my wife. Not until around 8:30 did I muster up the gumption to peer at code again. Feeling totally lost on an assignment takes the wind out of your sails. Nagging doubts about the economy, state of the world, future employability... well, those don't do you any favors either. I tried to go easy on myself and spied a solution to the Resize problem, using it to understand what was possible and how to assign new values to the header. I still don't totally understand it, so I'm going to peer into the supplemental videos and the previous assignment tomorrow.

Link to work: None.

### R1D10 :: Friday, the 7th of December (6/10)
Today's Progress: None.

Thoughts: Like yesterday, I felt down and out. I let the feelings take me, and I didn't code.

Link to work: None.

### R1D11 :: Saturday, the 8th of December (7/11)
Today's Progress: Completed PSET4.

Thoughts: After some grappling with the problem set and poring over Stack Overflow and other programming blogs, I figured out how to implement Resize and Recover in CS50x'a PSET4. I didn't feel quite as accomplished, as I had to pretty well read everyone else's struggles and tips to figure my situation out, but the results of my work were cool! And I understood its function./

### R1D12 :: Sunday, the 9th of December (8/12)
Today's Progress:  Watch an hour of CS50x's Week 4 lecture.

Thoughts: I was too tired after a couple of holiday parties the night before to make much progress. I did find the courage to dip into the next of David J. Malan's lectures. Does this study count as code?

Link to work: None.

### R1D13 :: Monday, the 10th of December (9/13)
Today's Progress: Finish watching the Week 4 lecture, begin PSET5.

Thoughts: This next problem looks like a real whammy. I am wondering what I am learning by jumping into such a deep pool of concepts such as linked lists, hash tables, and tries. I trust I'll come out the other side with a firmer handle on what exactly we are doing as computer scientists, software developers, programmers, whathaveyou. The scope of the lone problem in the PSET alone is a challenge!

Link to work: None.

### R1D14 :: Tuesday, the 11th of December (10/14)
Today's Progress: Continued wrestling with PSET5: coding the backend of a spellchecker.

Thoughts: Speller is a tremendous problem. I am proud to say morale is high; I would be happy to spend all day tomorrow working on it if I didn't have to go to work. I am trying to learn the fundamentals: what is a linked list vs a hash table vs a trie, how do nodes and pointers work, in what manner and fashion to we allocate and reallocate memory. What does C mean?! I have four functions to complete, and I am chipping away at the first. I learned to part structures and custom types and have decided on using a hash table for beginner's sake. I still haven't really written lines of code perse, but I am certainly learning to read them, and that is the first step!

Link to work: None.

### R1D15 :: Wednesday, the 12th of December (11/15)
Today's Progress: Hashed out hash tables. Started wrapping my mind around linked lists.

Thoughts: So Speller is a really huge problem for a beginner like myself. I've stated this fact the previous two days, and now I realize how unsystematic I've been in tackling it. That just won't do! What are takeaways? Make sure you (I) can implement the basics, basic functions, loops, structures, etc that will eventually comprise the final program. I've assumed I can watch videos, write a few notes, and shoot from the hip. It's clear I don't truly understand what's going on. I'm excited to go over everything with a finer toothed comb tomorrow. And let's keep in mind: What is the goal? What do I want?

Link to work: None.

### R1D16 :: Thursday, the 13th of December (12/16)
Today's Progress: Practiced Dynamic Memory Allocation and Pointers.

Thoughts: I need practice. Fortunately, I found https://study.cs50.net/ which features crisply distilled notes from CS50 and plenty of little exercises to practice core concepts. I believe I understand pointers (better). "A pointer is a variable that stores memory addresses." The value of the pointer is the memory address, which the type of pointer describes the type of data at that address. For example, "char* str = "what";" gives the address of the series of characters of what. "int* a = 7;" gives the address in memory of an integer 7. Calling * a gives the value while & a gives the address. I belive we are making baby steps. I'm eager to move on to other things, but I (believe I) need to understand these basics. I have to hunker down and focus and believe I can do this!!!

Link to work: None.

### R1D17-R1D18 :: Friday, the 14th of December to Saturday, the 15th of December (12/18)
Today's Progress: None.

Thoughts: Holiday parties, chores, and the siren song of the weekend lured me away from my programming practice.

Link to work: None.

### R1D19 :: Sunday, the 16th of December (13/19)
Today's Progress: Wrestling with Linked Lists.

Thoughts: I am struggling to understand linked lists and the nodes and pointers they require! I trust that by practicing problems, things will sync in. I did learn how to commit work to GitHub from Cloud9, so I can now have a record of activity on GitHub! Woo!

### R1D20 :: Monday, the 17th of December (14/20)
Today's Progress: Continued struggling with Linked Lists.

Thoughts: Every bit of time that passes with these things, I can feel that I can come closer to that mystical "Aha!" moment. I have been commenting code extensively and trying to backwards map solutions to other problems to speed my own process up. It's hard to put a timeline on learning, but I feel the pressure to move on to other things. I have started practicing at HackerRank to keep my Python fresh and to put my finger on the pulse of regular coding exercises. In all of the studying that I've been doing (videos watched, forums scanned, notes read), I cannot forget to just write lines of code. At this stage in the game, it's critical for me to keep that balance.

### R1D22 :: Wednesday, the 19th of December (16/22)
Today's Progress: HackerRank Day 8 of 30 Days of Code, Cash and Fahrenheit problems of CS50x/AP

Thoughts: Today was another hard day, ala Day 9. I'm really proud that I was disciplined enough to put in the time that I did, but I definitely felt in an mental-emotional slump that began with the beginning of the day and spiralled down, down, down until about 4:00 PM, when my wife told me it was okay to just chill out. I don't feel like I can afford to chill out, not when I'm trying to change careers in 8 months. I've been plugging through problems on HackerRank, which has been good Python review for me and may help me prepare for job interviews. According to reports I've read, the most in demand languages will be JavaScript, Python, and C++. I'm excited to jump on JavaScript, but I have to take care that I don't jump ship for its newness. CS50x PSET5 calls. I trust that with great blocks of time this break, I can crack the nut. I'm planning on at least 10 solid days of bootcamp, days of finishing CS50x, mapping the next few months of learning to job opportunities, and conceptualizing projects which I and potential employers will be struck by and interested in.

### R1D23 :: Thursday, the 20th of December (17/23)
Today's Progress: HackerRank Day 9 of 30 Days of Code. Finally got PSET5 to compile!

Thoughts: Aaaaand we're back! I tore back into PSET5, rewatching the impeccable yet elusive walkthroughs provided by CS50 and piecing together the needed materials from my own grown knowledge and bits and pieces from Reddit and Stack Overflow. I got the darn thing to compile! The load() function, responsible for loading a dictionary file into the program, is not totally working correctly. These problems are due to my own elusive grasp of pointers. I know what they are, but clearly I do not yet understand them. Regardless, today marked a day where I felt much more capable and literate than I have previously. We're going to make it! One step at a time...

### R1D24 :: Friday, the 21st of December (18/24)
Today's Progress: Pushed updates to PSET5 practice. 

Thoughts: Today marked the Winter Solstice, and the last day of school for 16-and-a-half days. To celebrate, I didn't do too much. I kept some streaks going, though, to be sure. I pushed some code in the CS50 IDE that I had added yesterday or the day before and neglected to update to Git. For that, I'll give myself a day. Play smarter, not harder! Keep those cards close to your chest! And get ready to kick some ass this break, because, going forward, Friday evening is the only break your going to get. Let's relive junior year of Mines all over again.

### R1D25 :: Saturday, the 22nd of December (18/25)
Today's Progress: None.

Thoughts: I went up to Bay with my bae and was pretty fatigued today. Not knowing exactly what to spend time on, I just let go of committing to an hour of code.

Link to work: None.

### R1D26 :: Sunday, the 23rd of December (19/26)
Today's Progress: Lecture 7 of Week 6 of CS50x and 1 HackerRank challenge.

Thoughts: Every little bit counts! I was inspired by the lecture on dynamic programming to come up with algorithms for my Seating Smart seating chart app. Can't wait to get to work on it! Busy with family and friend stuff. Of course, it is the holidays!

Link to work: None.

### R1D27-R1D29 :: Monday, the 24th of December to Wednesday, the 26th of December (19/29)
Today's Progress: The Holidays.

Thoughts: The Holidays.

Link to work: The Holidays.

### R1D30 :: Thursday, the 27th of December (20/30)
Today's Progress: FINALLY FINISHED PSET5! Lectures 8 and 9 of Weeks 7 and 8 of CS50x. Part of PSET6.

Thoughts: Today was Day 1 of my homebrewed coding boot camp. My goals: finish CS50x by the end of year and launch into the next chapter of self-development of becoming a developer. It's so nice having full days to work!
