The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on the 28th of November, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 :: Wednesday, the 28th of November
Today's Progress: Started Problem Set 3 in Harvard's CS50 course through edx (CS50x). 
                  Explored freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

Thoughts: I am a motivated machine! I woke up early so I could get in an hour coding in anticipation of working until late tonight.

### R1D2 :: Thursday, the 29th of November
Today's Progress: Finished Problem Set 3 of CS50x.

Thoughts: I took almost three hours to finish this assignment. I went down a whole of trying to figure out an algorithm for adjusting a frequency based on a difference in octave, note, and accidental. The solution was much simpler than I anticipated: a series of if/else if/else statement. I wondered about the value of learning the C syntax and wrestling with these problems. Regardless, I feel super accomplished at having made it through another problem set!
