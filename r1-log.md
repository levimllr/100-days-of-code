### R1D1 :: Wednesday, the 28th of November
Today's Progress: Started Problem Set 3 in Harvard's CS50 course through edx (CS50x). 
                  Explored freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

Thoughts: I am a motivated machine! I woke up early so I could get in an hour coding in anticipation of working until late tonight.
