# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Levi Miller

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on the 28th of November, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 :: Wednesday, the 28th of November (1/1)
Today's Progress: Started Problem Set 3 in Harvard's CS50 course through edx (CS50x). 
                  Explored freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

Thoughts: I am a motivated machine! I woke up early so I could get in an hour coding in anticipation of working until late tonight.

### R1D2 :: Thursday, the 29th of November (2/2)
Today's Progress: Finished Problem Set 3 of CS50x.

Thoughts: I took almost three hours to finish this assignment. I went down a whole of trying to figure out an algorithm for adjusting a frequency based on a difference in octave, note, and accidental. The solution was much simpler than I anticipated: a series of if/else if/else statement. I wondered about the value of learning the C syntax and wrestling with these problems. Regardless, I feel super accomplished at having made it through another problem set!

### R1D3-R1D5 :: Friday, the 30th of November to Sunday, the 2nd of December (2/5)
The days' progress: None.

Thoughts: I visited the Bay with my wife; her family lives there. As it so happens, a brother from another mother lives there as well. I was itching to keep coding and progressing. I want to move past CS50x so I can focus on a language and start building a portfolio. However, I can't neglect the fundamentals! Saturday was the closest day to a day off as I can remember; I really did almost nothing: nothing productive, hardly anything explicitly entertaining. There was a sense of peace and ease that I found in a few moments that was at first alien and then regenerative. That said, I feel my weekend days are the most valuable for advancing my skills as a computer scientist, software engineer, developer.

### R1D6 :: Monday, the 3rd of December (3/6)
Today's Progress: Watched Week 4's lecture in CS50x.

Thoughts: David Mahan's lectures stretch on for over an hour and a half. Lectures have not been the best means of teaching me something, yet his lectures are so finely tuned that I feel compelled to watch them. He spoke of what goes on under the hood of C; the callouts to addresses in physical memory that can stump one when a function or variable does not behave as expect. I am hungry to keep writing!

### R1D6 :: Tuesday, the 4th of December
Today's Progress: Completed Whodunit from PSET4 of CS50x.

Thoughts: This part of the problem set was a deep dive in the structure of a file, taking me to the granularity of individual bytes. The task seemed overwhelming, until I realized that the powers that be had all but given the answer away. All I wrote was a simple if statement to change the byte values of a pixel (or RGB TRIPLE) to different values! Nonetheless, the assignment was a valuable exploration of file formats. I'm excited to cut my teeth on the next part of the problem set tomorrow.
